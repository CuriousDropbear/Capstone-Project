<p>My project is centered on Data Science articles. These articles contain information on what is currently happening in our industry and how we talk about it. We primarily use theory to determine what trends are up and coming in our industry. I believe we can approach this from a more systematic perspective. We should perform a text analysis on Data Science articles published over the past 5 years (maybe 10?) so that we can visualize the most prominent topics and better understand how our industry has developed.</p>
